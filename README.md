# Periodic Table
 The periodic table, also known as the periodic table of chemical elements, is a tabular display of the chemical elements. It is widely used in chemistry, physics, and other sciences, and is generally seen as an icon of chemistry.
 
 As we all know everything is made of *protons*, *neutrons* and *electrons* which forms an **atom** or an **element**, and, this atoms connect with other atoms and continusly for countless times which makes a matter which we can see, touch, interect with. 
 
 **Atom** has some common behaviour that we can think of very easily.
 > Atoms consist of three basic particles: 
 > 1. **_Electron_**
 >      - More on [electron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron).
 > 2. **_Proton_**
 >      - More on [proton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton).
 > 3. **_Neutron_**
 >      - More on [neutron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron).

 > Atoms lack a well-defined outer boundary, so their dimensions are usually described in terms of an **_[Atomic Radius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_radius)_**. Atoms are extremely small, typically in between **30** to **300** Pico Meters (0.00003 to 0.003) . So we can think of as every atom makes their own radius by the movement of electrons, protons, and, neutrons in them.
